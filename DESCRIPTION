Title: Interface to Weather Underground Personal Weather Station (PWS) Data
Description: Provides API interfaces to Personal Weather Station (PWS) data
    maintained by Weather Underground (wunderground.com). Tables of PWS
    locations and metadata for user specified geographic areas are constructed.
    Robust retrieval of current and historical weather condition data for
    selected PWS. Computational tools for spatial analysis, including Kriging
    (Gaussian processes) for interpolation, as well as prediction of missing
    data and forecasts. Visualization of microclimate data methods including
    contextual static maps and interactive web maps. Facility to export data to
    CartoDB's spatial database hosting and webmap publishing
    platform.
